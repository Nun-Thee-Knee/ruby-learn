#Modules and Program Organization

Modules are bundle of methods and constants. However they don't have instances but rather the functionalities that we want to perform.

The class is the subclass of Modules

When we create a class using a module and then we override a method which was in the module and use the keyword 'super' then it retains the data of the previous function
